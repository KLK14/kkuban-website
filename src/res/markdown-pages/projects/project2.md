Utilizing the users network traffic data this Serious Game generates custom levels to allow the user to explore his own network. Hereby it teaches the differences and techniques of network protocols. It also gives the user an overview of all the different connections by visualizing his network as the level map.  
I implemented the game using C# and Unity.
