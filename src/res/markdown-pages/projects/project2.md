Utilizing the users network traffic data this Serious Game generates custom levels to allow the user to explore his own network. Herby it teaches the differences and techniques of the network protocols. It also gives the user an overview over all the different connections by visualizing his network as the level map.  
I implemented it using C# and Unity.
